# pylox
Pylox is a python implementation of the Lox Language Tree Walker interpreter explained in the [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) book.
The performance is obviously pretty bad since it's a Tree Walker interpreter in python.

This was developed on Python 3.8 (on Ubuntu 18.04) with no dependencies beyond the python standard library. Other Python versions have not been tested.

Start the Lox REPL with `python runner.py` or run a Lox script using `python runner.py <script_path>`.
